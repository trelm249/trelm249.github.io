<h1 id="earning-the-azure-administrator-associate">Earning the Azure Administrator Associate</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the years I have earned quite a few certifications from organizations such as CompTIA, Microsoft, Cisco, Red Hat, The Linux Foundation, and others. In that experience I have taken a few different style of test that range in difficulty. I have passed most the first time, and I have failed a few over the years. I mentioned all that to point out I am a veteran test taker that has studied for certification tests previously and have a rhythm I settle into to prepare. What works for me may not be what is best for you, but take what is helpful and go forth.</p>

<h2 id="what-and-why-the-az-104">What and Why the AZ 104</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As an associate level certification, this certification has no actual test prerequisites and is open to anyone to take. The target audience are those who will have responsibility for implementing and maintaining cloud solutions in Azure. That is an extremely broad audience that includes, but in no way is limited to, traditional sysadmins who are transitioning to cloud. It is not as broad as the AZ 900 in topics covered, but it does cover a lot. It also goes into far more depth than the AZ 900 and gets into the nitty gritty of how to actually do things in azure. This is a credential for technical people doing this on a regular basis. If you are looking to deploy infrastructure and implement solutions in Azure, this credential is relevant to you.</p>

<h2 id="prepping-for-the-test">Prepping for the test</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>After completing the AZ 900, I spent 10 weeks focused on preparing for the test. I took the test at a local Pearson testing center and passed it. From a difficulty level, it is pretty challenging. It is also pretty straightforward in lay out and how it asks questions. I recall no trick questions or confusing answer choices.</p>

<p><strong>Recomended areas of requisite knowledge</strong> Prior to going down the AZ 104 path I encourage you to already have a strong grasp of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Networking Concepts: I am talking CCNA or Network+ level of networking knowledge. Know TCP/IP, vlans, and routing works.</li>
<li>Virtualization: It will be helpful to have worked with VMware, KVM, Xen, or Hyper-V and managed virtual machines.</li>
<li>Containerization: The test covers containerization to some degree. There is no need to have masterd Kubernetes by any stretch of the imagination. Having played with Docker or podman on a single node and tossed together a dockerfile for your own projects is plenty. This is more familiarity than mastery.</li>
<li>Shell Scripting: Have some proficiency with bash or powershell (even better is both).</li>
<li>JSON: Having worked with json files will be helpful. Again, no need to master it. If you have a background with Ansible or Hashicorp products, that will likely get you there.</li>
<li>Storage: Have a strong grasp of both block and file storage concepts as well as NAS and SAN concepts. They will all come in play.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being weak in any of the above will add more study time to preparing for the test. This is my opinion and not based on any actual documentation from Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>Materials and Practices</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft vILT course: My employer participates in the Microsoft ESI program and I have access to free courses. So of course I took advantage of it. The course also came with an Azure subscription good for 30 days and $100 of credit to practice with. I encourage you to do the same if comparable is available to you. Check with your employer.</li>
<li>Microsoft Learn: Do not underestimate this material. It is interactive. It has sandboxes to practice many concepts. It is easily accessible. It is free.</li>
<li>The book “Azure for Dummies” by Tim Warner. It is well organized and easy to follow. It is very handy for offline study.</li>
<li>Practice Tests: I purchased the AZ 104 practice test from Whizlabs and found them helpful. There are other valid options available from a number of sources.</li>
<li>Self Paced video course: I made use of a course at Cloudskills.io for the Azure Admin that I bought. It was great material. You can find other great options ranging from free (John Savill’s Master Class on Youtube) to spending varyng amounts of money (Pluralsight, A Cloud Guru, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Leverage what you will from the above. I use so many resources so that I ingest the material different ways and from different perspectives. Mike Pfeiffer and Tim Warner will explain it differntly than John Savill or the instructor from my vILT Microsoft class. Also, practice with hands on. If you burn through the credits or time provided by a class subscription, or you don’t get one, then start an Azure personal account to practice with. Since this certification is for implementers, then you (by definition) should practice implementing.</p>
<p>Until next time, happy computing.</p>
