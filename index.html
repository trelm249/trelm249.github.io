<p>People find themselves working in Information Technology (I.T.) for sundry reasons. Some have a legitimate interest in the various disciplines found in I.T. Other people go into it because they hear it pays well. Occasionally some are pushed into it by friends or family (&quot;Oh you are so good with this stuff, you should do it professionally&quot;). However, if they don't enjoy I.T., they will not do well over the long term. I happened to inadvertantly discover I had an aptitude for aspects of I.T. and happened to enjoy it while taking a class in community college. That lead me down a path that has primarily focused on Systems Administation and Network Administration for the past 25 years. Over that time, I have learned a few things about longevity in the field.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are couple of mindsets that will lead to shortlived and or frustrating I.T. careers. As a result, they are lousy predispositions to bring with you into the various disciplines or fields that make up Information Technology. They stem from motivations that are related to &quot;I heard that is where the jobs/money is&quot;. High School and Community College counselors as well as certification boot camp sales people pushed this heavily for a while. While that push has waned, there are still plenty of people I come across today that have the following attitudes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;I am done with school and I just want to continue to do/be $WHATEVER_I_TRAINED_FOR.&quot;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alas, most of us figured out early on, to go into I.T. is to be a lifelong student. A brief survey of the industry quickly reveals it is ever changing. I originally trained on DOS 5, WFW, and NetWare 3.x/4.x supporting IPX/SPX networks. Yet many people have come into the field thinking that after school or initial training, they are done learning skillsets or technologies. I have worked with that person that had the mentality of &quot;I learned Visual Basic 5&quot; or &quot;I certified on Windows 2003 Server&quot; and that they we set for the next 20 years. It is not unussual for an individual with this mentality to grow frustrated and bitter as the industry moves on from their skillset. To remain a practitioner you must embrace the change. Make no mistake, it will change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;OK. I will learn this new skill/tech/platform, but the company has to pay for it and send me to camp&quot;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is true good companies do subsidize training and sometimes you need to go to a vendor sponsored training elsewhere to get your hands on it. That said, this attitude or comment is a passive/aggressive relative of 'I am done with school'. The reality is that my professional development is my responsibility. I figured out several years ago, even if I am working in house as a w-2 employee for somebody, I am ultimately working for myself. It is my reputation and my career to take care of, not my employers. Yes, good companies recognize all they really have is their talent and will take care of them. They do that to retain good up-to-date talent and remain competitive, not because it is their responsibility or that they are eat up with altruism. If your employer makes training available, it behooves you to take advantage of it. If they don't make it available to you, pursue it anyway. Go after what is free, low cost and put in the time to learn what interests you and what is on the horizon.</p>

<p><strong>Pay attention to the industry outside just your workplace</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is easy to get isolated in the silo of your shop. You spend five years there doing that and look up at where the industry has gone and it is like,&quot;Oh crap! When did that happen.&quot;. Follow industry sites and vendors. Listen to some good blogs from people in the industry. Look at where the big boys are throwing the money. An example of this has been to watch Microsoft transition to a services company primarily with all there XaaS offerings and are no longer primarily software company. Be attentive to patterns of change and look to what is 5 years out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Take some Risks</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be open to change and take some risks. I have moved a few times for job changes. That in no way means you have to or that you should. It may mean you need to be open to the idea of role changes, company changes, or even moving. In that same vein, challenge yourself in learning new skills and technologies. Your a sysadmin? Pick up a language. There are many to pick from. Obvious ones to look at are PowerShell, Python, Golang, HCL, Groovy, JS/TS, and some others. What if you are a traditional monolithic programmer? Learn about microservices and 12 factor applications, containers and so on. A little fear of the unknown and fear of getting outside of your comfort zone is understandable. The point is, challenging yourself can have some long term rewards. I went from being a NetWare guy to a WinNT/2000 guy, to a Cisco admin, to a Linux guy. At the moment, I am embracing containers and the cloud. Aside from gaining experience with these I have added some experience with git, Jenkins, and ansible. I jumped at the chance to join a team using agile methodologies and taking on a new role. This has happend a few times in the past couple of years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The bottom line is, it is your career. Adapt and go the direction you want to with it.</strong> I.T. is a very big field with a myriad of disciplines to pursue and every day new ones are added to it. There is no need to get left behind.</p>
