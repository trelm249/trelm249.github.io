<p>In my <a href="https://trelm249.github.io/20210318-adapting.html">previous post</a> I spoke of adapting and updating skill sets over time as the Information Technology industry changes. Anyone giving the industry any passing attention will recognize that it is ever changing. So how do we respond to that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reading the trade websites, blogs, and listening to podcast will inundate you with constant new products, methodologies, and vocabulary. New job titles and roles are created across the industry. Then there are job postings trying to fill positions with job skills requirements that read like a can of alphabet soup exploded on little Johnny's Christmas list to Santa Clause. Frequently the same job title can appear on a job posting from four different companies and mean completely different things on each posting. A great example is to ask a few hiring managers to define a DevOps Engineer or a Site Reliability Engineer. We need a bit of a plan to make some sense of it so that we can take action.</p>

<ul>
<li>You will not master everything. No one is good at it all despite what the job postings may indicate. Take them for what they are, a wish list.</li>
<li>The proverb concerning how you eat an elephant is applicable. You eat it one bite at a time. Give yourself permission to focus on one or two new skills at a time. Only with focus and repitition will you develop proficiency. It is the same with all skills, whether learning Hindi or Haskell.</li>
<li>Your career is a marathon, not a sprint. You will be at this for potentially several decades. Honing your craft will take time and as it does your skill set will grow and change. Like training for a marathon, you will cycle your training modes. But you don't ever really quit training.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Be deliberate and methodical in pursuing your new skills. By that, I mean set aside regular blocks of time that are devoted to that purpose. Also, don't be afraid to put some money on the line. Set a budget for a cloud based sandbox or a raspberry pi cluster to use as a home lab. It is an investment in your career and growth. Regard it as such. Also, set goals. If it is a certification, put it on the calendar. If it is code related, contribute to a project. Give your learning a practical outlet for others to peer review.</p>

<h2 id="choose-your-path.">Choose Your Path.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You are likely doing your studying and professional development on your time. To get the most out of it, spend it working on things you actually have an interest in learning. Do not pursue it because someone at work has some expectation of you studying this thing. If it is a job requirement, that should really be done on the clock on their dime. If this is you future proofing your career, then it should be your choice driving the direction your career is going. Just because everyone at work is thinking python is all the rage is not a good reason for you to pursue that, if your interested in learning golang or rust if that is more your flavor. If you see traditional Windows systems administration is fading, or at least your desire to continue it is, and you have an interest in Software Defined Networking; stand up a virtual SDN lab and get after it.</p>

<h2 id="hard-truth">Hard Truth</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep your career and your professional development in context. We do this to make a living. It does not define who we are and it is not our life. Be deliberate in giving time to the important things in your life. I informed a manager of mine one time that I would not make the data center an alter to sacrifice my marriage and family on. At the end of the day, we just manipulate bits on predominantly virtual computers on virtual networks sitting in virtual data centers. As a matter of character and ethic, we give the job the appropriate due. While there, it gets our focus and best. Our lives in the real world with our families in our communities is where we really live and leave a legacy.</p>
