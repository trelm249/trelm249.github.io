<h1 id="learning-azure-fundamentals">Learning Azure Fundamentals</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I wasn’t actually all that hyped to pick up Azure at the beginning. I had already been working with and learning Amazon Web Services and wanted to extend my skill further with AWS. However, the firm I am with joined the ESI partnership with Microsoft and I know it is likely that a client I work with will eventually go into Azure. So I availed myself of the opportunity to get free training and tests to grow myself.</p>

<h2 id="azure-fundamentals">Azure Fundamentals</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Having already passwd the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, I knew this was a good place to start. I learned basic Azure concepts and , more significantly, Azure terminology. This certification, the AZ 900, really is an overview that , like the AWS CCP, is a mile wide and an inch deep.</p>

<p><strong>Ways to Prep</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Leverage the free training from Microsoft Learning at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/ . You get access to free Azure sandbox time for some hands own and the material is very good. At this point, their is no need for the personal azure account. Save that for later.</li>
<li>Watch and listen to the Andrew Brown AZ 900 video at freecodecamp.org’s YouTube channel. It is a great review.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Really the two things above will get you ready for the Azure fundamentals test. As you progress to the more demanding certifications, more will most certainly be required.</p>

<h2 id="why-earn-the-az-900-as-a-technical-person">Why earn the AZ 900 as a technical person?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For a technical person, this certification does little to help you professionally. It does have some practical benefits.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, you see how Microsoft approaches the Azure tests at a discount. The fundamental tests are cheaper than the Associate and higher level certifications.</li>
<li>You spend some time focused on Microsoft terminology and mindset before you bite off the more difficult role based certifications. This is an iterative approach to learning building on layers.</li>
<li>You get something to show for your effort early on. This feeds confidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will go into the AZ 104 next time.</p>
