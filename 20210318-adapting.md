# Observations on Adapting an Information Technology Career Over Time 
2021-03-18

>People find themselves working in Information Technology (I.T.) for sundry reasons. Some have a legitimate interest in the various disciplines found in I.T. Other people go into it because they hear it pays well. Occasionally some are pushed into it by friends or family ("Oh you are so good with this stuff, you should do it professionally"). I happened to inadvertantly discover I had an aptitude for aspects of it and happened to enjoy it while taking a class in community college. That lead me down a path that has primarily focused on Systems Administation and Network Administration. Over the years, I have learned a few things about longevity in the field. 

## A Couple of Ways to Fail

>There are couple of mindsets that will lead to shortlived I.T. careers. As a result, they are lousy reasons or predispositions to bring with you into the various disciplines or fields that make up Information Technology. They stem from motivations that are related to "I heard that is where the jobs/money is". High School and Community College counselors as well as certification boot camp sales people pushed this heavily for a while. While that push has waned, fortunately, there are still plenty of people I come across today that have the following attitudes. 

**"I am done with school and I just want to continue to do/be $WHATEVER_I_TRAINED_FOR."** 

>Alas, most of us figured out early on, to go into I.T. is to be a lifelong student. A brief survey of the industry quickly reveals it is ever changing. I originally trained on DOS 5, WFW, and NetWare 3.x/4.x supporting IPX/SPX networks. It is not unussual for an individual with this mentality to grow frustrated and bitter as the industry moves on from their skillset. To remain a practitioner you must embrace the change.

**"I will learn this new skill/tech/platform, but the company has to pay for it and send me to camp"** 

>It is true good companies do subsidize training and sometimes you need to go to a vendor sponsored training elsewhere to get your hands on it. That said, this attitude or comment is a passive/aggressive relative of 'I am done with school'. The reality is that my professional development is my responsibility. I figured out several years ago, even if I am working in house as a w-2 employee, I am ultimately working for myself. It is my reputation and my career to take care of, not my employers. Yes, good companies recognize all they really have is their talent and will take care of them. They do that to retain good talent, not because it is their responsibility or that they are eat up with altruism. If your employer makes training available, it behooves you to take advantage of it. If they don't make it available to you, pursue it anyway. Go after what is free, low cost and put in the time to learn what interests you that is on the horizon.

## A Couple of Ways to Succeed 

**Pay attention to the industry outside just your workplace** 

>It is easy to get isolated in the silo of your shop. You spend five years there doing that and look up at where the industry has gone and it is like,"Oh crap! When did that happen.". Follow industry sites and vendors. Look at where the big boys are throwing the money. An example of this has been to watch Microsoft transition to a services company primarily with all there XaaS offerings. Find some bloggers to follow in the industry. 

**Take some Risks** 

>Be open to change and take some risks. I have moved a few times for job changes. That in no way means you have to or that you should. It may mean you need to be open to the idea title changes, company changes, or even moving. In that same vein, challenge yourself in learning new skills and technologies. Your a sysadmin? Pick up a language. Your a programmer? Learn an OS. A little fear of the unknown and discomfort can have some rewards. I went from being a NetWare guy to a WinNT/2000 guy, to a Cisco admin, to a Linux guy. At the moment, I am embracing containers and the cloud. Aside from gaining experience with these I have added some experience with git, Jenkins, and ansible. I jumped at the chance to join a team using agile methodologies and take on a new role. This has happend a few times in the past couple of years.

The bottom line is, it is your career. Adapt and go the direction you want to with it. I.T. is a very big field with a myriad of disciplines to pursue and every day new ones are added to it. There is no need to get left behind.
